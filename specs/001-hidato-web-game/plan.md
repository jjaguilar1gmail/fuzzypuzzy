# Implementation Plan: Hidato Web Game & Puzzle Pack Generator

**Branch**: `001-hidato-web-game` | **Date**: 2025-11-11 | **Spec**: specs/001-hidato-web-game/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-hidato-web-game/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deliver a responsive Hidato browser game (React + Next.js, TypeScript) with SVG grid, smooth feedback (TailwindCSS, Framer Motion), and local validation/state (Zustand + Zod). Content comes from Python-generated JSON puzzle packs (exported via a CLI build script) placed under the frontend’s public packs directory for static serving. Solver/generator remain in Python; frontend mirrors only the minimal domain (Grid, Cell, Position, Puzzle) for interaction validation.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Frontend TypeScript (Next.js 14+), Backend Python 3.11 (existing engine)
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Zustand (state), Zod (validation)
**Storage**: Static JSON packs served from frontend `/public/packs`; localStorage for client progress
**Testing**: Frontend (Vitest/RTL), Backend (pytest) — align with repo conventions
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop/mobile), offline-capable PWA later (Phase 2+)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + existing Python backend generator)
**Performance Goals**: <1.2s interactive on median mobile after cache; ≤100ms undo actions; smooth 60fps animations
**Constraints**: Accessibility WCAG AA; deterministic daily selection; no backend API for MVP (static)
**Scale/Scope**: Packs of 25–100 puzzles; grid sizes 5–10; future growth to larger boards

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Core domain separation upheld: frontend domain mirrors do not mutate engine; Python solver/generator remains pure and separate.
- Determinism honored: generator seeds and metadata retained in exported packs; daily selection deterministic.
- Safety & validation: Frontend validates inputs; does not overwrite givens; JSON schema validated via Zod; backend continues structural checks.
- Testing discipline: New frontend contracts and unit tests to be added; Python tests unchanged.

Gate Result: PASS (frontend tech stack is outside Python stdlib-only constraint; backend continues to respect it)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure adopted. Packs are generated by the Python CLI into `frontend/public/packs`. Frontend consumes them statically; no runtime Python dependency.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Separate frontend project | Clear separation of concerns; modern toolchain | Embedding UI in Python would hinder UX goals and PWA path |
| Client-side domain mirror | Local validation performance and UX | Calling backend for each move breaks responsiveness |
