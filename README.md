🧭 Hidato Puzzle Generator — Adventure Checklist

A step-by-step build plan for a handcrafted, modular Hidato puzzle platform in Python.

🌱 Setup

 Quest 0 — Project Skeleton
Create folders and empty class stubs with docstrings. Get a README in place and set up pip install -e ..

🧱 Core Foundations

 Quest 1 — Cells & Positions
Define Position, Cell, and Grid. Add basic get/set/iterate methods and print a simple 5×5 text grid.

 Quest 2 — Adjacency Rules
Implement a system to list neighboring cells (4- or 8-direction). Verify behavior at corners/edges.

 Quest 3 — ASCII Renderer
Build a text-based board printer that clearly distinguishes blocked cells, empty cells, and givens.

 Quest 4 — Constraints & Puzzle Container
Bundle rules (Constraints) and the grid (Puzzle) into one structure. Add basic export/import (e.g., JSON).

🧠 Path Generation

 Quest 5 — Path Builder v0 (Deterministic Serpentine)
Generate a clean “snake” path filling all cells. Confirm sequential numbering is correct.

 Quest 6 — Path Builder v1 (Randomized)
Add RNG and a bias to avoid dead ends. Generate different paths with different seeds.

✍️ Clue Placement & Puzzle Creation

 Quest 7 — Clue Placer v0
Always reveal 1 and N, plus a few random clues. Optionally experiment with symmetry.

🧮 Solving & Validation

 Quest 8 — Solver v0 (Greedy)
Implement simple consecutive-number placement. Produce a step-by-step textual trace.

 Quest 9 — Uniqueness Check v0
Add limited backtracking to count up to 2 solutions. Ensure puzzles are uniquely solvable.

 Quest 10 — Difficulty Estimator v0
Compute difficulty based on % logic solved, backtracks, branching. Map to Easy/Medium/Hard.

🎯 Adaptive Generation

 Quest 11 — Clue Placer v1 (Target Difficulty)
Loop clue placement → uniqueness check → difficulty estimate until target difficulty is achieved.

✨ Presentation

 Quest 12 — Pretty Output (SVG / PDF)
Create clean, publication-quality SVG or PDF renderings of puzzles and solutions.

 Quest 13 — “Play Mode” (Keyboard/Click REPL)
Add a simple interactive loop so you can play your own puzzles in the terminal.

🧠 Smarter Logic

 Quest 14 — Strategy Plug-ins
Modularize solving strategies (e.g., Consecutive Neighbor, Single Candidate). Enable toggling strategies for traces.

📦 Content & Variety

 Quest 15 — Packs & Seeds
Generate batches of puzzles (packs) with stored seeds and metadata for reproducibility.

 Quest 16 — Irregular Shapes & Blocks
Add support for blocked cells and irregular shapes. Ensure generator + solver still function.

🧼 Polish

 Quest 17 — Hygiene & Joy
Add configuration, timers, and logging. Keep a “bloopers” log of weird puzzles. Celebrate progress!

🌿 Optional Side Quests

 TUI Renderer — build a beautiful terminal UI (e.g., with Textual).

 Sound/Haptics — playful feedback for correct/incorrect moves.

 Tutorial Puzzle — step-by-step guided puzzle for new players.

 Daily Puzzle Mode — puzzle seed = YYYYMMDD.

✅ Tip: Don’t rush. Each quest should end with something you can see, touch, or screenshot. That’s your adventure log.

📸 Pro tip: keep a /progress_log folder with screenshots and notes from each quest — it’s surprisingly motivating to look back at.
